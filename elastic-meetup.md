        Seven Hills Technology is the organizer of the Cincinnati Elastic User Group. This group is for anyone interested in open source search, logging, analytics & data visualization. We primarily focus on these open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products" alt="elastic products" rel="noopener">(www.elastic.co/products)</a> — but we welcome talks on any aspect of data exploration.

                <h2>Distributed Tracing with APM and Microservices</h2>
                <h3>June 27th, 2019</h3>
                <p>For this meeting we're going to do a presentation and workshop on Distributed Tracing using APM. Bring your computers if you like and we'll have a sample github repo to clone that will be ready to set up with multiple microservices and we'll look at how distributed tracing is set up and can help you track performance metrics across a distributed architecture.</p>

                <h2>Getting Data into The Elastic Stack.</h2>
                <h3>February 28th, 2019</h3>
                <p>Given the numerous ways to ingest data into Elastic for reporting, monitoring, analytics, and full text search, it can be a challenging task to decide where to start.</p>
                <p>This talk will review things to consider when importing data, and the various methods to get data into Elastic, and how to handle the data once it's there. Discussion topics will include programmer APIs/SDKs, Beats, Logstash, Ingest Pipelines, and third party options.</p>

                <h2>Enhancing Search</h2>
                <h3>September 27th, 2018</h3>
                <p>Enhancing Search with Recommendations Search is a hard problem. Elastic search takes the power of the inverted index and enables developers to easily implement a basic search solution for their domain. However the demands and expectations on search will keep us on a quest for better results.</p>
                <p>In this session we will learn about several approaches to enhancing search with personalized recommendations.</p>
