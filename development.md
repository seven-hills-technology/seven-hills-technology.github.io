                You may have an idea for a mobile app. Maybe it’s more than an idea, and you’ve already started. Or maybe it’s less than an idea, and you need to find a way to improve your business through technology.

                No matter the situation you are in, we’ve dealt with it before. As a true technical partner, our goal is to provide you and your business value as quickly as possible. That means analyzing, scoping, and creating custom software in bite-sized segments to minimize your risk.

                No matter the purpose of the software, our passion and focus is creating unique and comfortable experiences for anyone who uses it.

                        We start each project by finding out your end goal. <strong>We do what most companies don't &mdash; listen.</strong> We want to know your loftiest goals and your realistic outcomes. We want to hear about all off the positives and negatives facing you and your organization. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we figure out everything we need to know about you and your organization, we work with you to prioritize what will give you the most value. From there, we start scoping out small projects so we can start our favorite part: <strong>delivering you value.</strong>

                        Like most modern development companies, we take an agile approach to building software. Unlike most modern development companies, <strong>we love when you’re extremely involved.</strong> Transparency has been one of our core values from the day we started our business, and we firmly believe it’s the only way to build incredible software.

                        We cycle through requirements definition, design, develompent, testing, and delivering on our projects in two week intervals. We recommend you read our post, “<a href="/business/2019/08/29/how-long-does-a-project-take" alt="Link to Blog Post">How Long Does a Project Take?</a>” to get a better idea of how we work.

                    <p>
                        Software is never done. <strong>Even when a project is “complete”, it’s never finished.</strong> After development is done, there are still technical items that arise, servers to be maintained, and upgrades to be made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We provide support and maintenance for every application we build. Our support includes working with you and your clients to <strong>find and solve issues, provide better understanding, and be a sounding board for new ideas.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Software maintenance is critical to prevent falling behind, or worse. With each new operating system, Android and iOS may require changes. With each database update, you may get better performance. <strong>We track and solve these issues without you breaking a sweat.</strong>
