            Putting a price on software development is a complicated task. To answer your base question, <strong>our projects typically fall between $50,000 and $200,000</strong>.

    <div class="sh-light-band-content">
        <p>There is no standard cost associated with a custom software project, as each project has its own unique requirements and complexity. While some apps are simple, others have several moving parts that add complexity and cost. Some examples in mobile apps that increase cost are tracking user locations, streaming audio or video, or integrated real-time communication such as a chat system or video calling. Examples of things in web apps that increase the cost are machine learning, integration between multiple systems, and advanced graphics or interactivity.</p>

        How we prevent project costs going too high
    </h2>
    <div class="sh-light-band-content">
        <p>
            While we don’t have a hard cap on the price per-project, we like to keep projects small. Large projects have a tendency to fail, and we understand that most businesses can’t afford for a failure when taking an endeavor such as custom software. <strong><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/23/hertz_accenture_lawsuit/" alt="Hertz/Accenture Lawsuit">We’ve all heard horror stories of large failed projects, but nobody ever provides a solution.</a></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a project where the end goal will cost around $600,000, there’s a high chance that requirements will change during the duration of building the software. Our main goal is simple: provide business value to you as soon as possible. So instead of taking on a huge project where requirements may change over time, we will split this large project into multiple smaller projects. The goal here is to break projects down into the smallest projects that deliver real value and then reevaluate the next steps because they may have changed.

            There’s a lot more value in the cost of custom software than just getting an app. We have assembled a tremendous team who is laser-focused on providing business value with every app we build. Below is a detailed outline of what value you’re getting when you pay us for a single hour of work:
        </p>
        <h3>Project Champion</h3>
        <p>
            Each project needs a champion. This person is the one responsible for the successful completion of the project. Depending on your time constraints and level of involvement, this might be you or a member of our team. The project champions’ main responsibility is remaining engaged in the project from start to finish and making sure any serious issues are resolved as swiftly as possible. The project champion is not the project manager, but will work closely with the project manager throughout the duration of the project.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Manager</h3>
        <p>
            A project manager is responsible for the day-to-day tasks of the development staff and making sure the project is running on time and on budget. The project manager will run the team’s daily standup meeting each morning, where developers “check in” to report their work from the previous day and projected work for the current day. This approach allows us to keep your project moving and keeps your costs down by clarifying any issues as soon as they are discovered.
        </p>
        <h3>UI/UX Designer</h3>
        <p>
            In today’s world, there’s no reason to have software that doesn’t both look <strong>and</strong> feel great to use. For this, we have a UI/UX designer involved in each project from the very beginning. They’ll work with you, the project champion, and the project manager to create user personas, journey maps, and mockups to detail the work the developers will complete. 
        </p>
        <h3>Tech Lead</h3>
        <p>
            The tech lead is the go-to technical resource for the project. This person must have a tremendous technical understanding and a detailed knowledge of the requirements. They will help clarify technical issues for the developers and handle more difficult technical tasks.
        </p>
        <h3>QA and Testers</h3>
        <p>
            Iterative testing is a necessity in modern software projects. The QA and testing team will make sure that all development tasks have been completed properly and are working in coordination with each other. 
        </p>
        <h3>Developers</h3>
        <p>
            We provide talented developers. The developers will take the business requirements and translate them into code. They work their magic to bring your idea to life. Skilled developers cut down the amount of bugs inadvertently added to the system.
