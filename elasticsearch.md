    <h2 data-scroll>Common Uses for Elastic</h2>
    <div class="">
        <div class="">
            <h3 data-scroll>Search Relevance</h3>
            <p data-scroll>Elasticsearch started out as a product for, well....search. Modern companies have a mountain of data, spread across dozens or even hundreds of systems. Getting a grip on organization data with Enterprise Search, or adding an Elasticsearch backed custom search to your applications ensures you have best in class search capabilities for your internal users and clients. We help clients organize their data, plan for how users will search that data, and ultimately discover how to get the most value out of their software through accurate and performant search.</p>

        <div class="">
            <h3 data-scroll>Data loading</h3>
            <p data-scroll>The Elastic Stack has a wealth of features that can help your organization make sense of data from hundreds of different sources, but one of the most important questions is, how does the data get into Elasticsearch? We've helped clients answer this question by showing them how to use the provided data shippers, called Beats, from Elastic as well as by building custom data shippers from data sources not directly supported yet. Understanding how data flows into Elasticsearch, what happens when things go wrong, how to handle back pressure, and other challenges is what separates a successful implementation from a failed one.</p>

        <div class="">
            <h3 data-scroll>Business Intelligence</h3>
            <p data-scroll>Having all of your organizations data gathered together and organized is great, but it's what you do with that data that sets you apart from your competition and gives you the decision making power to grow effectively. A core part of the Elastic Stack is Kibana, a business intelligence dashboard and management tool for Elasticsearch. Using Kibana, your users get access to real time analytics in secure portal that gives them the insights into their data they always wish they had. Our clients have found success using Kibana's maps and geolocation features, as well as customized dashboards for real time monitoring and tracking of their organizational data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="">
            <h3 data-scroll>Logging and Application Performance Monitoring (APM)</h3>
            <p data-scroll>With such a powerful tool to collect organizational data, it's easy to overlook the value of collecting data on your internal applications. The Elastic Stack ships with all the tools necessary to aggregate your internal application logs, and to collect metrics from your applications themselves, collecting all of this data for easy monitoring and analysis in Elasticsearch and Kibana. With APM you can see application errors and enable support and technical staff to resolve issues proactively and more timely than before. In an increasingly distributed infrastructure, our clients find success utilizing both APM and log aggregation with Elasticsearch to give a single source of truth to how applications are behaving when deployed and under active use.</p>
