                <h3>Strategic Software Planning</h3>
                <p>We work with you to evelop a deep understanding of your business, how software and technology impacts it, where it can improve, and how we can help. We then come up with a strategy to attack and get to work.</p>

            <h3>Custom Application Development</h3>
            <p>Off the shelf software products don't fit the need of every business. When business requirements are too complex or specific to a business or industry, or the cost for the correct software is way too high, building something custom is what you need. We can build software to fit your exact and custom needs, on any budget.</p>

    <h2>Our Unique Approach</h2>
    <p>
        Technology changes daily, so why hasn’t consulting? Traditional software development consulting is expensive, requires tons of up-front planning, and often leads to overly-expensive projects for underwhelming results.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Seven Hills Technology you get the flexiblity of in person planning and communication, combined with the ability for work to be done anywhere and any time.  We're local to Cincinnati, and love working with local businesses, and when it's time to sit down and work we provide our developers with the best tools and the best environment for them to be productive for your business. A unique pairing of on-site / off-site ability allows us to have developers in your office working with your team, or in our own workshop completely on your schedule.
